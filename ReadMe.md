# File Analysis Tool
File Analysis Tool, fat-rs for short, is a tool to analyze metadata of files, tool to guess file's extension and what it is for.
## What it supports
Right now it only supports zip archives (it still can provide general info about other file formats though)
## Roadmap
Building CLI, then GUI.
Support of modules, extensive library of all extensions that exist in this world (even if nobody uses them, kind of save-history project)
