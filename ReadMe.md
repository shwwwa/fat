# File Analysis Tool

File Analysis Tool, fat for short, is a tool to analyze metadata of files, tool to guess file's extension and what it is for.
Maybe later there will be support for conversion and viewing.

# What it supports

Right now it only supports zip/rar archives (it still can provide general info about other file formats though)

# Roadmap

Develop proper RAR archiver.
Building CLI, then GUI.
Print only needed info.
Support of modules, extensive library of all extensions that exist in this world (even if nobody uses them, kind of save-history project)

# Other sources

https://github.com/mmalecot/file-format - more generic scope on project (more useful one if you're trying to make a SPECIFIC reader for project, not general one like mine)
a lot of code borrowed from here to determine extensions
https://www.iana.org/ - mime types
http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/ - contains a lot of useful info about file formats and their identification
